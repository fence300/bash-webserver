# bash-webserver

This is my recreational implementation of a webserver written in bash, which uses netcat `nc` as the listener for incoming connections.  You should not run this on any production environment.  It is probably a security risk, even on development environments, and should only be done as a learning exercise.  

To that end, I am going to build up the webserver at each level of complexity using different branches to preserve the earlier stages if you want to easily flip between stages of development as each change is made.
